3. Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**

## Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Click **"Settings"** (top of your repository page)
2. Click **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select **"main"** from the branch dropdown
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

## Step 3: Access Your App

2. Click that URL to open your app
3. Bookmark it!

## Step 4: Install on Your Phone

### iPhone/iPad:
1. Open the URL in Safari
